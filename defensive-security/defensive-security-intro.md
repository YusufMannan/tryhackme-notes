## 🏆 Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** and its responsibilities.
- Learn about **Threat Intelligence** and its use in defense.
- Explore **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, including Malware Analysis.

---

## 🖥️ Steps I Took
1. Studied SOC responsibilities:
   - Monitoring for vulnerabilities, policy violations, unauthorized activity, and intrusions.
   - Importance of proactive threat intelligence.
2. Explored **Threat Intelligence**:
   - Collecting, processing, and analyzing data to understand adversaries.
   - Learning tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to predict and mitigate attacks.
3. Learned about **Digital Forensics**:
   - Investigating file systems, memory, system logs, and network logs to find evidence of attacks.
4. Understood **Incident Response (IR)** phases:
   - Preparation → Detection & Analysis → Containment, Eradication & Recovery → Post-Incident Activity.
5. Reviewed **Malware Analysis** methods:
   - Static Analysis: inspecting code without execution.
   - Dynamic Analysis: executing malware in a safe environment to observe behavior.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Tools
- **SOC Focus Areas:** vulnerabilities, policy violations, intrusions, unauthorized access.
- **Threat Intelligence:** logs, forums, adversary profiling, actionable defense steps.
- **Digital Forensics:** disk imaging, memory dumps, system/network logs.
- **Incident Response Phases:** Preparation → Detection → Containment → Recovery → Lessons Learned.
- **Malware Types:** Viruses, Trojans, Ransomware.
- **Analysis Approaches:** Static (code inspection), Dynamic (sandbox testing).

---

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Differentiating between **SOC tasks** (monitoring, analysis) and responsibilities of other IT/security teams (e.g., vulnerability patching).
- Understanding the **balance between prevention and response** in real-world security operations.

---

## 📌 Takeaways
- A SOC is central to proactive detection and response, but it collaborates with other teams for remediation.
- **Threat intelligence** makes defenses smarter by anticipating adversary actions.
- **Digital forensics** helps uncover attacker methods and preserve evidence.
- Incident response requires **preparedness, clear methodology, and follow-up** to strengthen defenses.
- Malware analysis is essential for understanding attacker tools and preventing reinfection.
